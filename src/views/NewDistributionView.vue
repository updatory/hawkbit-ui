            Motivate teams to do their best work. Offer best practices to get users going in the right direction.
            Be bold and offer just enough help to get the work started, and then get out of the way. Give accurate
            information so users can make educated decisions. Know your user's struggles and desired outcomes and
            give just enough information to let them get where they need to go.

            Focusing on the details gives people confidence in our products. Weave a consistent story across our
            fabric and be diligent about vocabulary across all messaging by being brand conscious across products
            to create a seamless flow across all the things. Let people know that they can jump in and start
            working expecting to find a dependable experience across all the things. Keep teams in the loop about
            what is happening by informing them of relevant features, products and opportunities for success. Be
            on the journey with them and highlight the key points that will help them the most - right now. Be in
            the moment by focusing attention on the important bits first.

          <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 dark:text-white">Be practical, with a wink</h3>
          <p class="mt-1 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-400">
            Keep our own story short and give teams just enough to get moving. Get to the point and be direct. Be
            concise - we tell the story of how we can help, but we do it directly and with purpose. Be on the
            lookout for opportunities and be quick to offer a helping hand. At the same time realize that nobody
            likes a nosy neighbor. Give the user just enough to know that something awesome is around the corner
            and then get out of the way. Write clear, accurate, and concise text that makes interfaces more usable
            and consistent - and builds trust. We strive to write text that is understandable by anyone, anywhere,
            regardless of their culture or language so that everyone feels they are part of the team.
